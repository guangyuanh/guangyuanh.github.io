I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.princeton.edu/) at Princeton University, advised by [Prof. Ruby B. Lee](http://www.princeton.edu/~rblee/). I earned my Bachelor of Engineering degree from the [Department of Microelectronics](https://www.sic.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) at Tsinghua University in 2016.

My primary research focus lies at the intersection of computer architecture, security, and machine learning, with the goal of developing efficient methods for attack detection and mitigation. I built versatile hardware modules that support machine learning algorithms for anomaly detection. I designed security measures enhancing the processor security, particularly through the design of security caches aimed at thwarting side-channel attacks and speculative execution attacks.
