I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.princeton.edu/) at Princeton University, advised by [Prof. Ruby B. Lee](http://www.princeton.edu/~rblee/). I earned my Bachelor of Engineering degree from the [Department of Microelectronics](https://www.sic.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) at Tsinghua University in 2016.

My primary research focus lies at the intersection of computer architecture, security, and machine learning, with the goal of developing efficient methods for attack detection and mitigation. I built versatile hardware modules that support machine learning and statistical algorithms for anomaly detection. I designed hardware features for enhancing processor security, particularly through the design of secure caches aimed at thwarting side-channel attacks and speculative execution attacks.
